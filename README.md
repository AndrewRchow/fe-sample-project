Shopping Cart Project
=======

This simple project is intended to give us a taste of your personal coding style. Please do your best to create an interactive and *responsive* UI that matches the mockups in the PDF file in this repo. Don't fret over completeness or correctness of the product. We would like to see what you can produce in just a few hours of coding. We're looking for your approach to the problem, how you organize your code, what features you see in the mockup and any ways you might improve things.

We used the Lato font in the example (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) and have provided stock images for you to work with. The data about the products can be found in the JSON payload file. **Happy coding!**
